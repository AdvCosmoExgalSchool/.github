## Prerequistes

For most of the summer school, you will only need a Python installation and some easily installed Python packages. We will cover this below in the **Python Environment** section. You will need some extra software for the simulations portion, which we'll walk you through in the **Simulation Dependencies** section.

HOWEVER, if you are a Windows user you will need to do some extra work. A few pieces of software will not run on Windows reliably but run without issue on Linux. If you are not a Windows user you can skip the following section.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Microsoft have made it much easier to run a Linux virtual machine on your Windows machine. You can use this to ensure you can take part in the hands-on workshops that are part of this summer school.

To run Linux we will use the `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>`_. To install WSL simply follow the instructions detailed `here <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command>`_. It's a simple process that involves a few command line commands, let us know if you have any trouble.

Once you have Linux up and running simply open the terminal and you can clone the repositories into a location of your choosing and move onto the next sections.
