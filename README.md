## Prerequists

For most of the summer school, you will only need a Python installation and some easily installed Python packages. We will cover this below in the **Python Environment** section. You will need some extra software for the simulations portion, which we'll walk you through in the **Simulation Dependencies** section.

HOWEVER, if you are a Windows user you will need to do some extra work. A few pieces of software will not run on Windows reliably but run without issue on Linux. If you are not a Windows user you can skip the following section.

### Windows subsystem for Linux

### Python Environment

### Simulation Dependencies
